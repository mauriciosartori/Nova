 * A peak element in an array A is an A[i] where its neighboring elements are less than A[i].
 * So, A[i - 1] < A[i] and A[i + 1] < A[i].
 * Assume there are no duplicates. Also, assume that A[-1] and A[length] are negative infinity (-âˆž).
 * So A[0] can be a peak if A[1] < A[0].
 *
 * A = [1,3,4,5,2] => Peak = 5
 * A = [5,3,1] => Peak = 5
 * A = [1,3,5] => Peak = 5
